# Smite Trivia Bot

This Twitch bot includes a Smite trivia system that allows viewers to test their knowledge of Smite gods and abilities.

## Features

- **Ability-to-God Mapping**: The bot loads comprehensive data about all Smite gods and their abilities
- **Interactive Trivia**: Viewers can participate in trivia games by guessing which god owns a specific ability
- **Real-time Responses**: The bot responds immediately to trivia commands and answers
- **Case-insensitive Matching**: Answers are accepted regardless of capitalization

## How It Works

### Starting a Trivia Game
Any viewer can start a trivia game by typing:
```
{trivia-ability}
```

The bot will respond with a random ability and ask viewers to guess which god owns it.

### Answering Trivia
Viewers can answer by typing:
```
{trivia-god name}
```

For example:
- `{trivia-Zeus}`
- `{trivia-Thor}`
- `{trivia-Hercules}`

### Example Game Flow

1. Viewer types: `{trivia-ability}`
2. Bot responds: `ðŸŽ¯ TRIVIA TIME! Which god has the ability: Lightning Storm? Type {trivia-god name} to answer!`
3. Viewer types: `{trivia-Zeus}`
4. Bot responds: `ðŸŽ‰ @ViewerName got it correct! Zeus is the right answer!`

## Data Structure

The system uses an extended version of the Smite gods data (`data/smite_gods_extended.json`) that includes:
- God names
- Ability names
- Image URLs
- Profile URLs

## Files

- `data_loader.py` - Main class for loading and managing Smite data
- `trivia_handler.py` - Handles trivia game logic and chat interactions
- `data/smite_gods_extended.json` - Extended data file with abilities
- `test_trivia.py` - Test script to verify functionality

## Integration

The trivia system is integrated into the existing Twitch IRC client (`twitch/irc_client.py`) and will automatically:
1. Load the Smite data when the bot starts
2. Monitor chat for trivia commands
3. Handle trivia games and responses
4. Continue supporting existing LLM functionality

## Testing

Run the test script to verify everything works:
```bash
python3 test_trivia.py
```

## Commands Summary

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `{trivia-ability}` | Start a new trivia game |
| `{trivia-god name}` | Answer the current trivia |
| `{any other text}` | Pass to LLM for general chat |

## Technical Details

- **Data Loading**: Happens once when the bot starts
- **Memory Efficient**: All data is loaded into memory for fast lookups
- **Thread Safe**: Designed to handle multiple concurrent users
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing data or invalid inputs

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements could include:
- Score tracking for viewers
- Multiple difficulty levels
- Ability to ask about specific gods
- Cooldown periods between trivia games
- Leaderboards
